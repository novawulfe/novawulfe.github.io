                  <hr>
                  <h2 id="be-intro">Intro</h2>
                  <p>Most of the advice on this page will be more centered around D&amp;D, but it should still prove useful in other systems. The reason for this is that each system has their own guides on enemy difficulty and how to balance it around the player. D&amp;D uses a monsters CR (Combat Rating) other systems have their own and it would be impossible to mention them all.</p>
                  <p>What this guide will do however, is show you how to build FUN encounters and create your own variants of enemies, how to introduce them in interesting ways to the party and what you can do on the fly to tweak an encounter if it is too hard or too easy for the players. Therefore it is not criticallly important which system you are using, but D&amp;D will allow me to provide examples and design tables that can then be tweaked and applied to other systems.</p>
                  <h4>Encounter Building Software</h4>
                  <p>I fully recommend looking to see if anyone has built encounter generation software for your RPG, the chances are they have. D&amp;D has plenty, but the one I recommend is DnDBeyonds, it is currently in Beta and requires you to sign up to a free account to access, but it is wonderfully fast and lets you search for just the right creatures to throw at your party, with a rough guide on how difficult it could be for them.</p>

                  <h4>It's not just about clicking some buttons</h4>
                  <p>Something to note, no matter what Encounter Builder you use, or if you do it yourself on paper or follow tables. That is not all there is to an encounter. You can't just select 3 hobgoblins and 2 bandits and be done with it, thats no fun! No you need to think about a few of the following topics, which we will go through one by one.</p>

                  <h2 id="be-design">Designing the encounter</h2>
                  <h4>Is this going to be a major plot point, or filler content?</h4>
                  <p>This is the first step when designing an encounter, because it will determine the kind of encounter you want to build.</p>
                  <p>If this is intended to just be filler content, something to occupy the PCs for a segment of a section but with no real connection to the main plot or a side plot, then skip to "How do you spring the encounter". However if you wish to include this as part of story content you need to consider some extra things when building the encounter, everthing from when you spring the encounter to who is fighting the PCs needs to have a reason. We will go through all of the following topics assuming you are encorporating it into a larger story as it can help to build better encounters anyway.</p>
                  <h4>Should there be any pre-plot leading to this encounter?</h4>
                  <p>So if this encounter is part of the main story or even a side story it could be good to setup some pre-plot reasoning here. As an example, lets say you are running a story near a coastline and you want to ambush the party with some smugglers. It could be a good idea to show the PCs that there is a smuggling ring in this town, have them notice shifty characters and unmarked boxes. You could even have them bump into the exact NPCs you plan to have attack them. They could get into an argument or be annoyed that the PCs are dealying them from their important work. Later when you spring the encounter and have these same smugglers appear, they can do a callback to the previous interaction, you could have the leader go for the person who annoyed him most etc.</p>
                  <p>The reason we want to do this kind of thing is for world building. The players get to feel like this is a living breathing world that carries on around them even when they arn't directly interacting with it. They feel like they could of not met these smugglers, or had it gone better maybe avoid this entire encounter. It just adds some life to the whole world rather than "6 spiders leap out at you in the woods" or "2 kobolds are running towards you from the end of the corridor". These kind of encounters seem much more like filler and delay content to a party, and they don't remember them for long. But I can guarantee they will remember being insulted by Jack 'one-eye' McGee then getting to stab a dagger in his neck on his own boat later that evening.</p>
                  <p>You can even sow these seeds many sessions in advance, have them get in a bar tussle with someone on the first night in a new city. Then have that character try to assassinate them a month later when they return to town. Being able to call back information and remember things that occured gives the players a sense of a living world and brings them excitement that any thing they do today could come back to hinder or help them at a later date.</p>
                  <h4>How do you spring the encounter?</h4>
                  <p>This question is not so easily answered and relies on what pre-plot, what area and what actions players take.</p>
                  <p>Usually you have a particular instance you wish the encounter to go down "The players enter the kitchen of a castle" or "The party triggers a magic mouth spell, alerting the enemies on guard duty".</p>
                  <p>In these fixed scenarios it can be very easy for the party to never trigger them, or to diffuse them someway, leaving you unsure of how to spring it. For this reason I prefer to have my triggers and encounters be seperate objects.</p>
                  <p>What do I mean? So first lets consider a trigger, this is some plot device that starts an action. Everything from opening a door, setting off a trap, or being spotted by a guard due to a bad stealth roll could be triggers.</p>
                  <p>Keep these generic and moveable. Don't have a specific door set as "the one that triggers the action" or don't have being spotted in some specific part of the castle be the trigger that sets off the guards. Instead have it be "a door in a dungeon", "being spotted anywhere in the castle they shouldn't be", "pressing the wrong rock in a wall". Then at moments you feel fit the players, have these triggers reveal and trigger themselves.</p>
                  <p>This way the action can be triggered at any time you need and can even be delayed, maybe the party got spotted entering the kitchen, but the guards don't attack them until after they leave or at a later point in the castle. The action can still be linked to the trigger, it just keeps it flexible so that you don't end up having the party miss out on something.</p>
                  <p>Now a word of warning here, don't use this as a "well they dispelled my magic trap, so im going to have the guards find them anyway" mentality. If players are using their skills and abilities to avoid the trigger completly. Maybe they stealth around the whole castle very slow, checking every corner. Then that is fine, they are actively roleplaying ways to avoid your triggers and thats amazing, having a party who want to fully RP and think about all their actions is great as a GM. You can also use this encounter at a later point in the story with a different dungeon, as your trigger is generic and moveable.</p>
                  <h4>What type of area are the PC's in?</h4>
                  <p>It's very important to consider the area the PCs are in for 2 reasons, 1. The kind of triggers and enemies they might find that thematically fit and 2. What the PC's might do.</p>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                      <p>So addressing point 1, we've established any pre-plot and what triggers we are going to use. Lets see if we can tweak it or have it better fit our scenario. Does a magic mouth spell work if this castle has no wizards? maybe not. But a guard dog sure does!. Likewise, does it make sense for them to fight a Lizardfolk in a witches tower? Or a frost giant in a lava ethereal plane? It seems simple but I have played many a game where I end up fighting spiders in places they would have no natural prey or kobolds in the middle of fields during the daylight, when they get disadvantages and are often found underground of in dungeons. I bring up another good "where are they" point there too, the time of day. Would wolves hunt in the night? Would a vampire attack the players in the morning? Keep all these things in mind and it will help to make your encounters fit your world.</p>
                      <p>Now point 2 ties into point 1. If the players are in the middle of a dark dungeon, how do they feel, what are they expecting. The might be thinking "I bet theres pit traps and kobolds here, ill check every floor tile and keep my torch low to not reveal us". If they are in the middle of a well lit ballroom in the Kings Castle, they are probably thinking "I need to keep up appearances, not look shifty, not do anything stupid, but atleast nothing is going to attack me.".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                      <img src="/img/scifi jungle soldiers tall.webp" class="img-fluid shadow">
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Now the reason this is important for us DMs to consider is "Subverting Expectations". Maybe a group of warlocks teleport into the kings Ballroom and catch the party totally unaware, maybe the dungeon has no spike traps, no traps at all in fact, giving them a false sense of security, so that on the way out after getting the treasure they don't check for any and now WHAM, they get hit by one. You can also plan around obvious uses of detect magic or sense undead or prepping a fireball for being ambushed etc. if you think how the players would be thinking and feeling in this scenario. It really is great to drop the exact opposite of what they are expecting on them and it always makes for a memorable RPG moment.</p>
                  <h4>What types of Monsters would be there?</h4>
                  <p>So this one might seem like we already covered it in previous points. But I am more talking about the dynamics of the creatures. Is it 6 kobolds, is it 4 kobolds and a hobgoblin leading them? Is it going to be 2 seperate packs of creatures who fight each other. Maybe its a single leader type villain and some henchmen, do the henchemen flee if the leader is killed?</p>
                  <p>Think about why these creatures are attacking the party too, is it for money, is it out of hatred. Is it out of surprise even? Maybe these creatures are willing to be spoken too and the fight can be avoided or are they going to be hardenned assassins who want nothing but to kill their target.</p>
                  <p>So by type of creature, we are talking more about their motivations, values, party composition and how the fight might go down. Also how do they specifically react and interact with the party? Is there an orc vs a party of 5 Elves, he might not be willing to retreat in that scenario compared to 5 humans etc.</p>
                  <h4>What abilities and skills do the monsters have?</h4>
                  <p>This point requires you working with the other points discussed. The reason being, if you put 5 melee characters against a party of ranged players, will they even get to them? If you put Dwarves against a party of Dwarves will they prefer to get an Ale and talk it over rather than fight.</p>
                  <p>You also need to consider some tactics, do the monsters have abilities that synergise well leading to combos, can one root a player whilst another melees them.</p>
                  <p>At this stage most of the work is done for you if you are taking them direct from rule books, but you also might want to homebrew some skills or change things up to fit your campaign or your players party more, we will discuss homebrewing monsters a bit later. For now just think about how you think the fight will go and what you want it to feel like.</p>
                  <h4>Do you want to make the party feel epic? or try to kill them?</h4>
                  <p>This topic concerns one of the very first lessons I learnt as a DM and it goes like this.</p>
                  <p>If you want to kill the party, throw lots and lots of creatures at them, if you want them to feel awesome use one big creatures.</p>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                      <p>The reason this works in almost every RPG is that a single big target, a villain a giant legendry creature etc. requires the party to work together, combine their abilities and strategise. When the target falls they feel like they accomplished something amazing. Likewise with tons and tons of creatures even if they are one shotable by the party, can cause chaos, players attack what they think is the biggest threat to their individual character, there are often too many targets to focus down one at a time and in the chaos they tend to get hurt and come out of the fight feeling like they got beat down.</p>
                      <p>So when you plan the encounter, think about if this is to be an "epic party inspiring moment" or a "beatdown of epic proportions" or even just a small delay and a comfortable fight for them. Make sure your creatures and their abilities fit this design.</p>
                      <p>I won't go into specifics of picking creatures here because each RPG system is different and they all use their own difficulty ratings. I will add some specific D&amp;D advice at the end of this page though.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                      <img src="/img/fantasy angel battle tall.webp" class="img-fluid shadow">
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <h4>What kind of RP could exist around this encounter?</h4>
                  <p>We already covered the feelings and motivations of the creatures, so when thinking about that, really think about the kind of RP that could occur, the players will!</p>
                  <p>So like with the example of the dwarves sharing ale instead of fighting, think about what your monsters might say back, what they might be feeling, what might motivate them to stop fighting or to reveal information. Prepare some possible ideas for what might occur, because you never know when a player might try to RP instead of fight.</p>
                  <h4>Is it going to be fun?</h4>
                  <p>This is a trick one, after you have covered all the previous steps, look back at the encounter, consider what tactics the players and monsters might use, what abilities will get thrown about, what environment hazards might occur, what RP could come from it and put your self in the position of a player. Is this going to be fun? Or are they going to just throw Eldritch Blast after Eldritch Blast at the targets until they are all dead and move on.</p>
                  <p>Other things you can consider here are what kind of combat RP could you say "You smash the lizards head against the cold stone wall" etc. and what kind of loot might the party find after? or what clues or hints or sideplot could you add in from the encounter. It all adds up bit by bit to make it feel more than random filler content.</p>
                  <h4>Summary</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Major plot encounters require more thought than filler content</li>
                    <li>Consider ways to introduce the encounter before the actual encounter</li>
                    <li>Keep your triggers generic and unattached to the actual encounter</li>
                    <li>Consider the area the party is in and how they might be thinking/preparing</li>
                    <li>Consider who would be fighting them and why</li>
                    <li>Think about the monster synergy and motives, consider RP options</li>
                    <li>Think about the skill and ability synergies of monsters, consider modifying to better fit a fight against the players</li>
                    <li>Are you trying to hurt the party? Or give them an epic moment, pick number and style of monster accordingly</li>
                    <li>Consider all the various non-combat options around the encounter before, during and after</li>
                    <li>Finally look back over it all, think about it as a player and decide what can be changed to be more fun!</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Fun it up with RP RP RP!</h4>
                  <blockquote>"Kobold is going to attack you barry, does ac15 hit? ok it does 3points of damage, now its your turn barry"</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>"Oh uhh ok, hmm, well I guess I hit it with my sword, I rolled a 1...", "Ok you take 2 points of damage from your sword"</blockquote>
                  <p>Hopefully none of you have RPG games like the above, where combat boils 100% down to rolling dice and checking damage numbers, lets see how I would describe the above and how I would encourage my players to RP back (can take some work to get them involved, be patient and RP for them if they need it).</p>
                  <blockquote>"The largest kobold looks around the party and locks eyes on you Barry, he takes out his rusted sword and slashes at you at great speed, (I already know my players AC as I am prepared) the swords slashes you across the arm, stinging and causing blood to rush down your leather armguard. You feel weakened, take 3points of damage and then retaliate against your foe".</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>"I scream out in rage and slash right back at the kobold aiming for his neck, I rolled a 1...", "In your anger you forget to grip your sword correctly as you raise it above your head to slash down, your hand slips, causing the hilt to smack you in the head with a crack, for 2 points of damage".</blockquote>
                  <p>Hopefully you can all agree that the second version of those events is far more interesting both as a player and a DM. Now I can hear many of you newer DMs going "Oh god but that means I have to adlib that stuff on the spot, I can't do that!! Well do not fear, because I am going to show you a really easy way to breakdown combat and give you some more examples, then as you practice using them you will get better and more confident in how to respond.</p>
                  <p>For combat use this simple trick, think about the steps actually going on, Start, Middle and End.</p>
                  <p>Describe each step individually but keep it simple.</p>
                  <p>Use real world senses and emotions to help convey things, touch, sight, smell, how the PC or NPC might feel etc.</p>
                  <div class="section section-secondary">
                    <h5>Example - With colour highlighting differnt senses/emotions</h5>
                    <p><strong>Start</strong></p><p>Your fireball <span class="sense sound">crackles</span> and <span class="sense look">swirls</span> as it <span class="sense feel">lurches</span> forward, <span class="sense look">engulfing</span> the target in flames.</p>
                    <p><strong>Middle</strong></p><p>You smell their leather armor <span class="sense smell">singe</span> as they are blasted back with a <span class="sense sound">thud</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>End</strong></p><p><span class="sense sound">Screaming</span> out in pain <span class="sense emotion">they grasp for one last hope of survival</span> before collapsing to the floor in <span class="sense sound">silence</span>.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>If you keep that 3 step process and the tip about senses and emotions in mind, you should be easily able to come up with things on the fly, just keep it simple a single descriptive word is enough for most situations. The tips about senses is also really useful for describing places, items and people to the party!</p>
                  <p><small>For more examples of using the senses and feelings for descriptions check out the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ answer</a> for, "How can I give better descriptions".</small></p>
                  <h4>Adapt on the fly</h4>
                  <p>This section is about a few things. Firstly it could mean, your monsters are overtuned and are killing the party, what do you do. It could also be the opposite. But it can also mean, what if this encounter isn't going how you planned, the party are RPing and you didn't plan for it, or it started in a place that is giving the party huge advantages over the enemies, how do you change things up on the fly and still seem like it was all planned.</p>
                  <h5>The monsters are killing the party</h5>
                  <p>This one is a pretty easy one to solve on the fly and I will cover some ideas from worst to best</p>

                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                      <div class="section section-secondary">
                        <p>So the method I would never suggest is "Have the monsters flee". The only time this would be acceptable to me is if the monster was some kind of villain and you planned on bringing them back later, this could be them just toying with their prey. But why would a group of 5 kobolds who are winning suddenly flee? Don't do this without good reason.</p>
                        <p>The middle ground option, dice fudging. Now I am not a fan of dice fudging, I prefer to have the game play out as a game, the dice are part of that game. But if this is session 1 and the very first encounter is going to kill your players AND you can't think of a better option. Maybe making a monster miss or do less damage once in a while isn't too bad.</p>
                        <p>Another option similar to this is, remember you control the monsters. You can decide WHO they attack, maybe stop smacking the wizard and have them focus the paladin whos full hp? This option at least seems more natural and less "cheater" than dice fudging.</p>
                        <p>The best option that I always try to start with, Roleplay. Just as the players can roleplay their way out of combat, you too can start roleplay. Maybe your monsters, realising they are winning offer the PCs their lives if they surrender, or maybe they ask for a gold donation to stop killing them? With this option just think back to your notes on building the encounter, why are these monsters here fighting the party. You can usually figure out an alternative solution to a TPK(Total Party Kill).</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                      <img src="/img/scifi soldier dead tall.webp" class="img-fluid shadow">
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Now with all these options, don't be afraid of a TPK, sometimes killing all the players is the most memorable part of an adventure for everyone. Killing a few players is also great, ive had parties in the past try and revive their dead allies and go on huge side plots just to do so etc. So think about what you want to achieve and if you want them to die or not.</p>
                  <h5>The monsters are too easy</h5>
                  <p>Again fairly simple to solve and has a few ways to handle it.</p>
                  <div class="section section-secondary">
                    <p>The easiest solution would be to spawn more monsters of the same type. More monsters makes things harder even if the party is one-shotting them. It can lead them to be overwhelmed, taking damage even in easy fights and/or running out of spells or abilities they where using to kill so fast.</p>
                    <p>Another good one is to have a larger creature appear, maybe the 5 goblins fighting the party made so much noise they woke up the Troll sleeping in the back of the cave and now he appears midway through combat.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>However sometimes it might just be best to cut your losses, have the party finish the encounter fast and go check your notes after the session to figure out why and plan better in the future. Just don't worry too much about it, as long as people are having fun thats what really matters in RPGs.</p>
                  <h5>The encounter is not going as I had envisioned</h5>
                  <p>Now for the tricky one with no obvious solution. There can be so many variables in RPGs that you cannot plan for them all. Did the party start the encounter, throw oil and fire into the room and run away barring the door. This maybe isn't what you thought the encounter would be like, but like I always say, RP is full of these moments of surprise and that's what makes it so great over other media. Players will tackle problems in their own individual ways and you could run the same One-Shot 50 times and have different things happen and surprise you.</p>
                  <p>My advice is just to go with the flow, keep things fun, use Matt Mercers "Rule of Cool" and if the players want to trap the whole encounter in a burning room, just RP it out and let them, it could lead to some memorable gaming moments.</p>
