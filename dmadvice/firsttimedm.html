                  <h1>Your first time DMing</h1>
                  <hr>
                  <h2 id="1t-intro">Intro</h2>
                  <p>Presumably at this point, you have played some games as a player in your preferred system and wish to try your hand at DMing, but some of you might be leaping straight in with a bunch of friends who are also new and you drew the DM straw.</p>
                  <p> Learning to play using just the Rule Books can be like learning to read from a dictionary. The rulebooks are great for most systems, but they act more as a reference manual, for after you know how to play.</p>
                  <p> Personally I would recommend running a short adventure campaign or oneshot module and just knowing a few basic rules to start with. Short adventures can teach you how encounters are built and structured, how story and plot can be presented, give you ideas about interactions and roleplay, guides for building puzles &amp; clues and give you descriptions and items to feed to your players. All you have to do is read it, make some notes and then run it.</p>
                  <p>After you have run something pre-written, I would advise running another pre-written module, but adding some custom content to it, an encounter you built, a quest you wrote, or just some new places in a town where RP can occur. This will let you test ideas and figure out how to create things, without worrying about the whole world story or overarching plots.</p>
                  <p>I want to keep this guide system agnostic so that it can be used by anyone starting out with any system, but I will at times reference things to D&amp;D as that is the largest and most well known/played system out there and usually there is an equivilant to something I mention in other systems.</p>
                  <p>Likewise I also want this guide to apply to phyiscal in person playing &amp; playing digitally online, so I will try and mention both aspects, or say when something might not apply to one.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2 id="1t-start">Where to start</h2>
                  <h5>Picking A System</h5>
                  <p>If you have yet to pick a system and are just starting out, I would 100% recommend D&amp;D as it has tons of player created content and guides that you can use and learn from. If D&amp;D is not your style then below is a list of great systems that are not too deep for a new DM to pick up and play in a few weeks:</p>
                  <div class="section section-secondary"> 
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>D&amp;D</strong> - The classic Dungeons and Dragons system, deep but built in chunks, you can ignore special races and rules until you are more comfortable</li>
                      <li><strong>Pathfinder 2.0</strong> - A system based on D&amp;D 3.5e, very similar to Dungeons and Dragons but has some streamlined rules and different approaches</li>
                      <li><strong>Starfinder 2.0</strong> - Similar to pathfinder 2.0 but based on sci-fi and will see the players in gun battles, using space ships and exploring planets</li>
                      <li><strong>Monster of the Week</strong> - A casual, fast to start system, monsters and mystery set in modern times, characters are created quickly on the first session and it does not need maps or a ton of prep, also lots of pre-written 1shots for it.</li>
                      <li>Call of Cthulhu</strong> - As you can guess by the name its lovecraftian, it uses percentages for dice rolls, players roll a d100 (2xd10) and try to score under their stat to succeed. Beware if you run this, its an RPG with alot of player deaths, its almost part of the point of it though just make your players aware.</li>
                      <li><strong>Fate Core or Fate Accelerated</strong> - Fate Core requires some special + and - dice, but it only uses these d6 special dice to add or remove from skill checks, its more of a framework than a system, as you can apply any genre or world to it, you will however find tons of things the community has written and adapted already</li>
                      <li><strong>Warhammer Fantasy &amp; Warhammer Wrath and Glory</strong> - Based on Games Workshops worlds, wether you want ye olde dark fantasy or the grim dark future, theres plenty of existing content and information you can apply to campaigns in these systems, both have been reworked recently to be alot more easy to run for players</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <h5>What do I need as a DM?</h5>
                  <h6>Rulebooks</h6>
                  <p>Once you have a system I 100% recommend getting yourself a copy of the Core Rulebook. Most systems will label this as the "Core Rules", D&amp;D however has a Players Hand Book(PHB) and a Dungeon Masters Guide(DMG). You will want both as a DM, especially if your players do not intend to get a PHB themselves as it will allow them to use your copy to create their characters and look things up. So just do a bit of googling for your system and I am sure you will find the right book to start with. You will want this wether playing physically or digitally.</p>
                  <h6>Dice</h6>
                  <p>After that you will probably want some dice! Check what your system uses, but it can't hurt to make sure you have atleast a few D6, amd atleast D4, D8, D10, D12 &amp; a D20. Do check though because systems like Fate Core use special +- dice and Warhammer uses multiple D20. You might also want some spares for your players. If you intend to play digitally, you can probably skip this step, unless you enjoy rolling physical dice as some people do.</p>
                  <img src="/img/dice.webp" class="img-fluid shadow">
                  <h6>An adventure</h6>
                  <p>Next up I recommend picking up a short campaign, oneshot or starter box. Some starter boxes come with a basic copy of the rules, others have the full rulebook but most if not all usually come with an adventure module you can run.</p>
                  <h6>A place to play</h6>
                  <p>This could be a living room in yours or a players house, a pub, a gaming club or a virtual tabletop(VTT) using roll20, fantasy grounds or similar online. Just somewhere where 5-6 people can be together, look at maps and roll dice.</p>
                  <h6>A notebook</h6>
                  <p>As a DM you will have lots to track, from player initiative, to monster statblocks and plot hooks, you 100% need a place to write this down, either a physical notebook or somekind of digital not taking software. I personally use software even at a table, because you can do useful things like creating hyperlinks, randomly generating stats and items or loading up multiple bits of content at once easier. A quick look at some of the software I use is:
                  <div class="section section-secondary">
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong><a href="https://www.worldanvil.com" target="_blank">World Anvil</a></strong> - For creating and reusing worlds, creating interlinked maps and information and sharing it to players between sessions, also great for writing up session reports and making notes on plot hooks and secrets you created during a session. It can also be a great note taking tool as a player, as it has several features that let you track your characters story, create fast notes or list achievements you have earned.</li>
                      <li><strong><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank">DnDBeyond</a></strong> - The king of rulebooks and character sheets. Not only does it have every official rulebook and adventure module in nicely formated structures with a searchable database. But it is fantastic for creating character sheets on, sharing them with people and sharing content you have purchased with your players (for a small subscription fee). You can also find homebrew content from other players and some useful tools for DM's such as encounter builders. Some digital tabletops can also link to DnDBeyond character sheets such as Roll20 using the Beyond20 browser plugin, letting you roll from DnDBeyond right into the virtual tabletop itself.</li>
                      <li><strong><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank">Scrivener</a></strong> - This is a very very useful writing tool, it lets you link between documents fast, creating nested directory trees and organize your plots, homebrew rules, pregenerated NPCs etc. Very useful too if you don't fancy something like world anvil, or prefer to have offline software.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <h6>Optional Extras</h6>
                  <p>These things can be nice to have but are in no way required to start DMing in any system, however they might help you run the game, create ideas, control combat or have more fun for you and the players so keep them in mind.</p>
                  <div class="section section-secondary">
                    <img src="/img/cyberpunk tactics people wide.webp" class="img-fluid shadow">
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Maps</strong> - Some good maps, either digital or printed can help everyone keep track of whats going on in the game, where monsters are and how they are moving about the world, it can also let you trigger traps and show magical items or clues to the players. You can find lots of these online, some free, some paid, or you can <a href="/dmadvice/creatingmaps.html">create your own!</a>. In the <a href="/resources.html">resources</a> section of this site you will find places you can aquire maps for free too.</li>
                      <li><strong>Tokens &amp; Condition Trackers</strong> - Tokens represent players, monsters, npcs, items etc. in your world, use them in conjunction with maps to bring your game to life. They can come in the form of paper discs or fully 3d models, but either way they help show whats going on in the game. Condition Trackers are markers or cards you can give to players to remind them they are poisoned, or that they have disadvantage on skill checks etc. Both are very useful to have at the table and most VTT's have ways to track conditions for characters in the game built in.</li>
                      <li><strong>Initative Tracker</strong> - Whilst you can write players and mosnters iniative down on paper as they roll it and then tell players whos turn it is, most VTT's have built in turn trackers that show everyone who is up next and help players plan their actions. In physical playing there are trackers people have built made using magnets, or you can get clips that go over your DM Screen, or use a laptop and a digital tracker such as the one built into World Anvil and show the players with a second monitor, theres many ways to do this, but I recommend picking up something everyone can see as it helps keep combat flowing and players engaged.</li>
                      <li><strong>A VTT</strong> - Digital players you are able to play without a VTT, using the "Theature of the mind" and a voice chat software like skype or discord, but it can be alot of fun and smoother to run using a VTT like <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank">Roll20</a> or <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com" target="_blank">Fantasy Grounds</a>. These VTT's let you track iniatives, load maps, move tokens around, see players roll virtual dice and make checks using virtual character sheets. They even allow for music and lighting effects on maps to make players feel even more engaged in the world. Also great for sharing images of items, monsters, clues etc. and replicate that "everyone in the same room" feel of physical play.</li>
                      <li><strong>A voice chat software</strong> - Digital players again, you will need a way to voicechat when playing, I have seen people play with all text chat before, but if you are seeking a more authetnic RPG experience, then voice chat is essential and most of them out there are free such as Discord or Skype. You could even go one step further like my main D&amp;D group does and have webcams running so you get even closer to the in person physical experience of playing RPGs.</li>
