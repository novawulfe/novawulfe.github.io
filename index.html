  <h1>13 Golden Rules To Survive Hardcore WoW</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to play hardcore WoW and many kinds of players, but over the years I have developed some "Golden Rules" for survival in hardcore. If you follow these then you will have a much easier and safer time reaching max level.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rule 1</strong> - NEVER fight or quest things above your level.<br />If a quest you just got sends you to higher mobs, then just go grind somewhere on same or below-level mobs until you ding and can do that quest, is it worth risking 30 hours of leveling, for 30mins of grinding? There are numerous reasons why, higher health mobs, reduction in hit chance for you and increased crit chance for them are a few, just don't risk it. Oh and whilst we are at it, avoid elites, even same-level ones, only take them on if 100% required and you out level them by 3-5 levels minimum.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 2</strong> - Always have a plan!<br /> Even if you are just going to kill 1 single mob, in the middle of an empty field, ALWAYS have an idea of where you will run if something happens, always know you have potions or a panic ability like vanish ready. Check the mobs skills using an addon like ClassicBeastiary, it's always nice to know if the mob has thrash or a stun. Fail to prepare - prepare to fail!</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 3</strong> - If things don't go to plan, immediately run.<br /> Did the mob stun you at a really bad time, did a key ability miss, did another mob spawn. I don't care if you have 80% hp and the mob you are fighting is about to die, run, and I mean right away, don't hesitate the decision, make this an instinctual reaction. 9 times out of 10 it will be an overreaction but that 1/10 you just saved yourself from wiping, and that is ALL that matters. You can always go back and re-fight the mob again later if you got out safe...you can't come back from the dead.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 4</strong> - Learn to spin strafe jump.<br /> When a mob hits you in the back you can get dazed, common knowledge. However, they cannot daze you to the front or sides. If you have a 'mob swing timer addon' this can really help you practice too, otherwise you just sort of learn the rhythms. When a mob is about to swing, jump spin 180 so it hits you in the face, spin back 180 and land, and continue running away. If you can't get the hang of the spin jump, then you can also just strafe or turn to face the mob every hit but the jump is better as you don't lose momentum or speed during it.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 5</strong> - Understand mob leashing for groups.<br /> If you hit a mob with 3 other mobs around it, those 3 mobs get their leash timer tied to the first mob you hit, and every time you hit that first mob or one of the 3 extras they all reset their leashed mobs timers even when kiting away from their spawn. HOWEVER, if you were to aoe all 4 mobs at the same time with any aoe spell or grenade, they each get their own individual leash timer, this means you can focus one down whilst kiting and the other 3 will eventually reset.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 6</strong> - Caves...but also towers and boats.<br /> Everyone will tell you "caves are dangerous" but people forget about towers and boats. All 3 share similar traits, usually only one way in and out, labyrinth-like designs with twisting overlapping paths and dense mob populations. In some cases towers and boats can be worse because wow doesn't handle verticality well and mobs can and will hit you from above and below when you think you are out of their reach. Before entering all of these, wait for cooldowns to be ready, have a plan, and most importantly of all, do not enter already cleared areas, wait for respawns and clear them yourself, because the last thing you want is for mobs to be respawning around you as you enter, knowing when the area was cleared and when respawns will be, is far safer than going in blind and hoping.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 7</strong> - Know your class.<br /> This sounds stupid, but I see so many people not knowing the nuances of skills they have, the cooldowns, what mobs certain spells don't work on, buying unnecessary ranks of abilities (looking at you frost nova) etc. Just do yourself a favour and read and understand what your skills, talents and racials do in and out.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 8</strong> - Watch your Buffs/Debuffs.<br /> Honestly nothing is worse than finishing a mob, celebrating your victory and then dying because you still had a poison on you. Likewise dying and realising you didn't have your Frost Armor up, or your shield was available etc. Keep an eye always watching over your buffs, debuffs and cooldowns etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 9</strong> - Know your enemies.<br /> Similar to knowing your own class, know your enemies. Use addons like ClassicBestiary to find out if a mob has thrash (multihit), or a stun effect, or a fear you were not expecting etc. A lot of this comes from experience but addons or looking up enemies on wowhead can be a great start.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 10</strong> - SURVIVE over everything.<br /> What I mean by this is, do not worry about wasting a cooldown, or a potion, or overresponding to a situation. You being alive is all that matters, you can always get more potions, wait for cooldowns, go back to fight a mob after getting out or loot at a later date. Do not put anything over survivability, not quest objectives, not finishing off a mob and not "wasting tools", survive!</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 11</strong> - Kill every mob.<br /> No really I mean it, even if you kill them whilst kiting, do not skip mobs. Not only will this help keep your xp higher, and thus help you to out-level questing areas, but it also reduces the chances of you getting into a daze scenario and having mobs gang up around you to put you in the grave. Just kill all the mobs in your path, always, hardcore is not a race it's a survival journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 12</strong> - Don't Panic.<br /> They say in a life or death scenario you really find out what kind of person you are. Well you can train this behavior, if something goes wrong hopefully you already have an escape route as part of your plan (rule 2). But if you don't just breathe, think about what options you have and abilities you have (rule 7) and choose the best routes you can to escape. Do not instantly hit your panic button vanish/bubble, do not instantly pot, there may be times when using these slightly later will have far more effect. Rule 10 states to survive over everything, but part of survival is patience, timing and keeping calm under pressure, and then using your potions and abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 13</strong> - Have fun!<br /> Having fun and playing your way is all that matters at the end of the day. Hardcore only means deletion on death, so don't let anyone else tell you you are "playing hardcore wrong". If you want to trade with people, group up for quests, buy and sell on the AH, use leveling guides, abuse rested XP to help level or anything else, that is all a valid way to play hardcore and I hope you enjoy your time reaching max level!</li>

    <h1>Talents</h1>
    <p>These talents have been specifically selected for key reasons and in specific orders, make sure you follow the order shown below the main talent window on wowhead as there may be key survival talents you need to go for earlier rather than later etc.</p>
    <div class="talent-cards">

      <div class="talent-card druid">
        <h2>Feral Druid - Damage</h2>
        <p>This spec primarily focuses on increasing damage mid to late game, whilst boosting overall survivability from low to high level.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brutal Impact</strong> - Longer stuns = less damage to you, more time to escape etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Furor</strong> - Essentially gives you a constant stream of rage or energy when shapeshifting for various survival scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Natures Grasp</strong> - An instant guaranteed root on a target chasing you.</li>
          <li><strong>Cure/Abolish Poison</strong> - Do not forget this exists, especially when dealing with insect-type mobs, nothing worse than finishing a tough fight and still dying because of a poison tick!</li>
          <li><strong>Barkskin</strong> - At 1 min cooldown, use this ability often, do not wait for a panic scenario to use it, it can stop you getting into that scenario to begin with!</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Tauren</strong> - Bonus stamina racial 5%! They get an aoe stun, compared to Night Elf they take the top spot.</p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/druid/-5052501323222151-55002/1ACgHeKnmq2ABE1PmnRseeeeJD" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card hunter">
        <h2>BM Hunter - Damage</h2>
        <p>A spec focusing on maximum early damage when your pet is likely to be weaker, and then buffing your pet to survive and hold agro later.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aimed Shot</strong> - This is your big nuke and it can be cast at the start of the fight whilst your pet is generating some threat.</li>
          <li><strong>Intimidation</strong> - Guaranteed stun on demand.</li>
          <li><strong>Spirit Bond</strong> - 12% hp a minute doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be super useful to just keep your pet ticking alive during a fight, that's essentially increasing their hp by 12%.</li>
          <li><strong>Feign Death</strong> - If I have to explain this one to you, you probably shouldn't be playing hardcore...</li>
          <li><strong>/cleartarget [dead]<br />/targetenemy [noharm]<br />/petattack<br /></strong> - Use this macro to send your pet to your current target, will save your life when a mob spawns on top of you when fleeing somewhere etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Most Races</strong> - For hunter racial isn't as important, orcs get increased pet damage, dwarfs get a poison/bleed removal, Night Elfs get a free stealth, Trolls get a minor attack speed boost, overall just pick what you feel for this one. Dwarf is probably the strongest to help remove status effects before a feign death.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/hunter/5300320152521251-0505103/1BDeG0AFbbbhjjjjKmmmpNmmRsQjE" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card mage">
        <h2>Frost Mage - Survival</h2>
        <p>Mages already possess a lot of damage tools as well as some great survivability, this just takes it to the next level for not dying!</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Elemental Precision/Arcane Subtlety</strong> - Nothing worse than having someone resist frost nova or polymorph.</li>
          <li><strong>Frostbite</strong> - 15% chance to stun on all frost attacks, this includes frost/ice armor meaning when running away mobs may get rooted in place making your escape easier, other times its just going to boost your dps by keeping mobs away.</li>
          <li><strong>Iceblock/Icebarrier/Manashield</strong> - It's immunity or absorption to damage, you should be using these all the time.</li>
          <li><strong>Frost Warding + Arcane Resilience</strong> - These combined give you a very nice armour boost especially for late game when a single melee hit could be the difference between a blink cd reset or death</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Gnome / Undead</strong> - Both get great racials for escaping certain crowd control effects, undeads is stronger as blink can already remove roots, but it never hurts to have a backup, being stuck in place is a death sentence for a mage.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/mage/230005001--25353233102051131/2CAEbbjbbbgMggfqfHPt0AbbbFj2Dsssr" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card paladin">
        <h2>Prot Paladin - Survival</h2>
        <p>This spec heavily focuses on survival early and dps late, it prioritizes prot tree before holy.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anticipation</strong> - Whilst boring on the surface, defence rating is simply an amazing stat on classic. Not only does it decrease your chance to be hit or crit, but it also buffs your block, dodge and parry!</li>
          <li><strong>Blessing of Sanctuary</strong> - You might have noticed the build doesn't take kings, that is because by the time you hit 30 you will be using Sanctuary 24/7. Reduces the incoming damage from attacks as a raw number and reflects back damage to the attacker (without re-leashing mobs when running!)</li>
          <li><strong>Holy Shield</strong> - In combination with Sanctuary and reckoning this is where your main damage is coming from, keep this buff up as often as possible, increases chance to block and on block reflects damage!</li>
          <li><strong>Spiritual Focus</strong> - This skill could save your life at the higher end levels, getting that heal off quickly vs being interrupted.</li>
          <li><strong>LAY ON HANDS</strong> - I've put that in all caps, because so many people forget it exists when they need it, so remember it! Just also remember it uses up all your mana apart from the amount it gives back so use other tools first if possible.
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Dwarf</strong> - Paladins already get access to poison, disease and magic removal, why not add in bleed and a nice 10% armour buff whilst you are at it!</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/paladin/545031-053050035001551/1BCeeHJeenppppQr0ACf1e0E1p0bbbb" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card priest">
        <h2>Shadow Priest - Survival</h2>
        <p>A fairly routine shadow priest build, it does prioritize safety over some other damage sources earlier than some builds.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spirit Tap</strong> - Fairly obvious one this, kill a mob get more mana regen, we only go 4/5 because 80% practically guarantees it's uptime is constant when fighting mobs, especially if you are wanding and not burning through mind flays.</li>
          <li><strong>Blackout</strong> - This gives all your shadow damage spells a chance to stun the target, very useful when fighting one mob, even better on multiple, gives you more time to mindflay or plan and free potential spell interrupts etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Vampiric Embrace + Improved</strong> - This skill becomes so much more useful once you get access to shadow form at 45 which stops you using most of your healing abilities without jumping out of that form. Use this as often as you require its a short CD</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Shield + Fortitude</strong> - We pick these up later in the leveling progress to just give us that bit more survival when entering the last 15 or so levels, its free health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Undead</strong> - No question here, it's always going to be Undead on classic, not only do you get a free anti-fear/charm racial, but the priest racial is like a second shadow word pain, except this one heals you AND the healing stacks with Vampiric Embrace.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/priest/05023--4502525103411251/0B2aaabbEhDabKmmpQmbRs0DE2bmGFn" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card rogue">
        <h2>Combat Rogue - Survival</h2>
        <p>This build tries to play it as safe as possible, rogues can be hard to level due to lacking hit chance especially when dual wielding, they also are not naturally tank and their CC relies on combo points.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lightning Reflexes + Endurance</strong> - You are stacking Agility, so let's boost that dodge chance as far as we can. Having sprint on a shorter cooldown is also really useful for mobility or getting out of somewhere quick.</li>
          <li><strong>Mace Specialization</strong> - We will be going dual maces for this build, so grabbing a 6% chance to stun on every single hit (both hands) is just great for some free cc and reduces pressure when aoeing with bladeflurry.</li>
          <li><strong>Vanish</strong> - I don't think I really need to include this here, if you play rogue you know how amazing this skill is at saving your life, it's that simple, use it!</li>
          <li><strong>Gouge</strong> - With improved gouge this gives you a 5.5sec stun on a single target, that's a lot of time to bandage or run!</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p>In classic almost every race can be rogue except Tauren, all of them offer pros and cons, <strong>Night Elf</strong> gives you a free instant second stealth, this used to be abused a lot in PvP as you can transition from it to normal stealth. <strong>Dwarf</strong> will give you the bleed/poison removal, something useful if you want to guarantee your vanish works. <strong>Undead</strong> have fear/charm break, <strong>Orcs</strong> have resistance to stuns and bonus damage, honestly pick your favourite, they can all be great.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/rogue/0053201-3250552100055100231/1ABFGcccNqppppVptw0CDEg1tccEh" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card shaman">
        <h2>Enhance Shaman - Prot/Survival</h2>
        <p>This is an interesting build, it's time to kill is lower than standard Enhance, but its survivability is so much higher, it comes from an era where blizz saw shaman similar to a druid and gave them legit tank talents.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shield Specialisation</strong> - That's right its a 1handed/shield ehnance build! 5% increased block chance and 25% increase in absorbed amount, for a tier 1 talent, yes please.</li>
          <li><strong>Anticipation + Toughness + Parry</strong> - These 3 combined just up your defence by so much, physical damage reduction, dodge chance and the ability to parry as well as your block, you will be tougher than kodo hide!</li>
          <li><strong>Earthbind + Stoneclaw totem</strong> - Slow or taunt your enemies, both have their uses when kiting, mob focusing or fleeing</li>
          <li><strong>Grounding Totem</strong> - 100% not enough people use or remember this exists, spell caster mobs in classic hit HARD...too hard...send those spells to your totem instead and save yourself some health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p><strong>Tauren</strong> - Whilst orc has a nice stun resist, the combination of an aoe stun (something shamans lack) and 5% bonus health puts them above orc in hardcore leveling for me.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/shaman/550001-0505230055503151/1BdddEddjjjKqPjRsj0BAf1FM" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card warlock">
        <h2>Demo/Aff Warlock - Damage</h2>
        <p>Warlocks already get pretty great survivability as demonology, this build tries to buff your pets whilst keeping you alive and pumping those dots out.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improved Healthstone</strong> - It's a free potion, burn these badboys as often as you can, with a 2m cd you can always make more, don't be afraid to hit it at half hp even if you don't need it, you never know. This talent just buffs the healing you receive!</li>
          <li><strong>Fel Domination</strong> - Nothing sucks worse than your pet dying when something goes wrong, this single talent points lets you instantly summon them back so they can get the mobs off you again.</li>
          <li><strong>Fel Concentration</strong> - Having your life drain not get interrupted when you desperately need that hp is always going to be useful, we take this later in the leveling process as fights should be a lot shorter in early levels and you won't be mana tapping as often.</li>
          <li><strong>Shadow Ward</strong> - Far too many people forget this exists, similar to mages frost/fire wards, this is a shield that absorbs a large amount of shadow damage, great against certain mobs especially in later levels where demons and casters become more common.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p>Again you can't really go wrong with your choice here, each race offers something that isn't super useful but is a nice bonus. If I were to pick one ahead of the others it would be <strong>Orcs</strong> due to having increased pet damage, which means increased pet threat and a safer leveling experience potentially. <strong>Gnomes</strong> expansive mind is also a nice dps increase and mana boost.</p>
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5002240502-2051300152501051/0AD1CEAhjjjjMpjKdRs0fffHKEf" class="talent-button">View Talent Tree</a>
      </div>    

    <div class="talent-card warrior">
        <h2>Prot Warrior - Survival/Damage</h2>
        <p>Warriors are known for being the hardest things to level in hardcore. They have good damage in some builds, low CC, lack of survivability options or self healing. They also rely on rage to really do anything, this build essentially makes you a 1h/shield arms warrior with more survival. You will be in battle stance most of the time, in classic this still gives you access to rend, thunderclap, overpower, shield slam, sunder armor, shield bash and charge, for maximum rage generation, damage abilities and safety cc & panic buttons.</p>
        <h5>Key Talents/Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improved Sunder Armor</strong> - Yea that's right, sunder armor. <strong>Stop using heroic strike it sucks!</strong> Not only does it only add a little bit of damage for 15 rage, but it also doesn't count as an auto attack meaning it can't generate rage. If you want to do more damge, start stacking sunder armors instead, this will boost all your damage abilities not just the auto attack. </li>
          <li><strong>Improved Rend</strong> - Some may mock taking this early, but you would be surprised how much having a consistent DOT damage ticking can help when you just keep missing hits!</li>
          <li><strong>Anticipation</strong> - Whilst boring on the surface, defence rating is simply an amazing stat on classic. Not only does it decrease your chance to be hit or crit, but it also buffs your block, dodge and parry! (Yes I copied this from the paladin guide, it's still just as important though!).</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Overpower</strong> - You won't have a lot of abilities, so missing an auto attack sucks, getting a guaranteed follow up hit that is off GCD is great for anyone who thinks they can dodge you, and if it crits with this you get a free bleed applied.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Shield Bash</strong> - This one is core, I have said before spell caster mobs hit super hard in classic, and prot wars are not designed to deal with magic, so let's just silence that caster on demand shall we!
        </ul>
        <h5>Top Races</h5>
        <p>Again lot's to choose from here. <strong>Orcs</strong> racial stun resist is pretty useful on specific mobs. <strong>Taurens</strong> get that health boost and a free CC, something we could use on the war. <strong>Humans</strong> get nice buffs to weapon skill which is useful hit chance when leveling and <strong>Dwarfs</strong> have that armour boost and bleed removal, <strong>Trolls</strong> get some passive health regeneration in combat and an atk speed boost, so again you can't really go wrong with your choices here.</p>
